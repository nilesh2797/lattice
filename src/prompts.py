#region Tree traversal prompt with explicit reasoning
TREE_TRAVERSAL_PROMPT_V5_CLUSTER = '''You are an intelligent search agent navigating a hierarchical semantic tree of topics. Your mission is to predict the most promising candidates to find the answer to the user's query using the relevance definition below.

**Relevance Definition:** {relevance_defintion}

---

## USER QUERY

{query}

---

## CANDIDATES

Here are the candidates, each is identified by a unique `node_id` provided at the very start in [] (e.g., [0]).

{child_node_options}

---

## YOUR EVALUATION TASK
1.  First, identify the essential problem in the query.
2.  Think step by step to reason about why each candidate is relevant or irrelevant (based on the relevance definition). Provide this analysis in the `reasoning` field.
3.  Rank these passages based on their relevance to the query. Provide your ranking in the `ranking` field.
4.  Assign a relevance score from 0 to 100 (based on the relevance definition and the ranking). Provide relevances in the `relevance_scores` field.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT
You must provide your response as a single, clean JSON object. The JSON should have three keys: `reasoning`, `ranking`, and `relevance_scores`.

* `reasoning`: This must be a **string**.
* `ranking`: This must be an **array of integers** representing the order of the candidates.
* `relevance_scores`: This must be an **array of arrays** where each inner array contains [node_id, relevance_score]. For example: [[0, 85], [1, 92], [2, 73]].

**Relevance Definition:** {relevance_defintion}. A passage is considered relevant if its text, read in isolation, directly and substantively contributes to answering the user's query.

4.  Assign a relevance score from 0 to 100. The score must reflect how well the passage, *on its own*, substantively answers the query.
    * **High scores** should be reserved for passages that contain a direct answer or a critical piece of the answer.
    * **Low scores** must be given to passages that are merely titles, section headings, table of contents, or descriptions of other content. These are not useful as they do not contain the answer themselves.
    * Provide these scores in the `relevance_scores` field.
