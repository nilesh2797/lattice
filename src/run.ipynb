       "ID: [0], Num children: 9, Description: This topic cluster provides a multi-disciplinary exploration of human and animal biology, behavior, and evolution. It covers fundamental life processes such as reproduction, development, and aging (senescence), as well as specific anatomical systems like the eye and joints. The collection delves into key evolutionary concepts like Cope's rule and speciation, and examines traits with both biological and cultural dimensions, including handedness, color perception, and kissing. It also provides a detailed overview of the genus *Homo*, focusing on humans and Neanderthals.\n",

       "[0, [1], 9 children] This collection provides a comprehensive exploration of topics related to reproduction, development, and family dynamics in both humans and animals. It covers the biological and medical aspects of conception and birth, including twinning (monozygotic, dizygotic), superfecundation, parthenogenesis, and parturition. The node also delves into the developmental journey, examining the crucial role of REM sleep ontogenesis in CNS maturation and its link to disorders like SIDS and ASD. Furthermore, it analyzes the complex web of family and social relationships, including fatherhood, sibling dynamics (rivalry, birth order), and infidelity. Related medical emergencies like asphyxia are also detailed.\n",
       "\n",
       "[1, [15], 15 children] This topic covers the biology, function, and perception related to the eye and vision. It includes detailed information on the anatomy and physiology of the eye's components, such as the crystalline lens and tapetum lucidum, and processes like accommodation and phototaxis. The scope extends to the evolution of the eye (PAX6 gene), comparative animal vision, and related neurological concepts like optical illusions, sensory substitution (BrainPort), and self-awareness (mirror test). Clinical and medical aspects, including diseases like cataracts, refractive errors, and surgical outcomes, are also addressed, alongside practical applications like eye makeup.\n",
       "\n",
       "[2, [23], 5 children] This topic provides a comprehensive exploration of the various types and cultural contexts of kissing, detailing specific forms such as the cheek kiss (la bise), French kiss, and air kiss. It covers the cultural, historical, and religious significance of kissing, including social greetings, romantic intimacy, traditions like kissing under the mistletoe or at the Blarney Stone, and ritualistic practices in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. The topic also touches upon the scientific study of kissing (philematology) and associated health implications.\n",
       "\n",
       "[3, [27], 7 children] Provides a comprehensive, multidisciplinary exploration of color, covering its scientific principles, technological applications, and cultural significance. This topic includes detailed analyses of specific colors like red and green, examining their symbolism, political associations (communism, green parties), and historical use. It also delves into the technical aspects of color models like RGB and CMYK, the physics of light, the biology of vision (trichromacy), and the psychology and linguistic evolution of color perception."

In a shadow, the jellyfish can either remain<br>still, or quickly move away in bursts to avoid predation and also re-adjust toward a new light source.<br>This motor response to light and absence of light is facilitated by a chemical response from the ocelli, which results<br>in a motor response causing the organism to swim toward a light source.<br>Marine ragworm[edit]<br>Phototaxis and UV-avoidance of Platynereis dumerilii larvae responding to UV-light (380 nm) from above See text body for<br>further explanation.<br>Phototaxis has been well studied in the marine ragworm Platynereis dumerilii. Both Platynereis dumerilii trochophore and<br>its metatrochophore larvae are positively phototactic. Phototaxis is mediated by simple eyespots that consists of a<br>pigment cell and a photoreceptor cell. The photoreceptor cell synapses directly onto ciliated cells, which are used for<br>swimming. The eyespots do not give spatial resolution, therefore the larvae are rotating to scan their environment for<br>the direction where the light is coming from.<br>Platynereis dumerilii larvae (nectochaete) can switch between positive and negative phototaxis. Phototaxis there is<br>mediated by two pairs of more complex pigment cup eyes. These eyes contain more photoreceptor cells that are shaded by<br>pigment cells forming a cup. The photoreceptor cells do not synapse directly onto ciliated cells or muscle cells but<br>onto inter-neurons of a processing center. This way the information of all four eye cups can be compared and a low-<br>resolution image of four pixels can be created telling the larvae where the light is coming from. This way the larva<br>does not need to scan its environment by rotating. This is an adaption for living on the bottom of the sea the lifestyle<br>of the larva while scanning rotation is more suited for living in the open water column, the lifestyle of the<br>trochophore larva. Phototaxis in the Platynereis dumerilii larva has a broad spectral range which is at least covered by<br>three opsins that are expressed by the cup eyes: Two rhabdomeric opsins and a Go-opsin.<br>Platynereis dumerilii<br>However, not every behavior that looks like phototaxis is phototaxis: Platynereis dumerilii nechtochate and<br>metatrochophore larvae swim up first when they are stimulated with UV-light from above. But after a while, they change<br>the direction and avoid the UV-light by swimming down. This looks like a change from positive to negative phototaxis<br>(see video left), but the larvae also swim down if UV-light comes non-directionally from the side. And so they do not<br>swim to or away from the light, but swim down, this means to the center of gravity. Thus this is a UV-induced positive<br>gravitaxis. Positive phototaxis (swimming to the light from the surface) and positive gravitaxis (swimming to the center<br>of gravity) are induced by different ranges of wavelengths and cancel out each other at a certain ratio of wavelengths.<br>Since the wavelengths compositions change in water with depth: Short (UV, violet) and long (red) wavelengths are lost<br>first, phototaxis and gravitaxis form a ratio-chromatic depth gauge, which allows the larvae to determine their depth by<br>the color of the surrounding water. This has the advantage over a brightness based depth gauge that the color stays<br>almost constant independent of the time of the day or whether it is cloudy.<br>In the diagram on the right, the larvae start swimming upwards when UV-light switched on (marked by the violet square).<br>But later, they are swimming downward.

Drosophila melanogaster<br>has been studied extensively for its innate positive phototactic response to light sources, using controlled experiments<br>to help understand the connection between airborne locomotion toward a light source. This innate response is common<br>among insects that fly primarily during the night utilizing transverse orientation vis-à-vis the light of the moon for<br>orientation. Artificial lighting in cities and populated areas results in a more pronounced positive response compared<br>to that with the distant light of the moon, resulting in the organism repeatedly responding to this new supernormal<br>stimulus and innately flying toward it.<br>Evidence for the innate response of positive phototaxis in Drosophila melanogaster was carried out by altering the wings<br>of several individual specimens, both physically (via removal) and genetically (via mutation). In both cases there was a<br>noticeable lack of positive phototaxis, demonstrating that flying toward light sources is an innate response to the<br>organisms' photoreceptors receiving a positive response.<br>Negative phototaxis can be observed in larval drosophila melanogaster within the first three developmental instar<br>stages, despite adult insects displaying positive phototaxis. This behaviour is common among other species of insects<br>which possess a flightless larval and adult stage in their life cycles, only switching to positive phototaxis when<br>searching for pupation sites. Tenebrio molitor by comparison is one species which carries its negative phototaxis into<br>adulthood.<br><br><b>Reasoning:</b><br>",

It's too abstract and removed from the specific domain.<br>*   **[3]** This passage continues the philosophical discussion from [2], focusing on contrastive explanations and the<br>problem of infinite regression.

Many<br>tropical jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic zooxanthellae that they harbor within their cells.<br>The zooxanthellae nourish the jellyfish, while the jellyfish protects them, and moves them toward light sources such as<br>the sun to maximize their light-exposure for efficient photosynthesis. In a shadow, the jellyfish can either remain<br>still, or quickly move away in bursts to avoid predation and also re-adjust toward a new light source.<br>This motor response to light and absence of light is facilitated by a chemical response from the ocelli, which results<br>in a motor response causing the organism to swim toward a light source.<br>Marine ragworm[edit]<br>Phototaxis and UV-avoidance of Platynereis dumerilii larvae responding to UV-light (380 nm) from above See text body for<br>further explanation.<br>Phototaxis has been well studied in the marine ragworm Platynereis dumerilii. Both Platynereis dumerilii trochophore and<br>its metatrochophore larvae are positively phototactic. Phototaxis is mediated by simple eyespots that consists of a<br>pigment cell and a photoreceptor cell. The photoreceptor cell synapses directly onto ciliated cells, which are used for<br>swimming. The eyespots do not give spatial resolution, therefore the larvae are rotating to scan their environment for<br>the direction where the light is coming from.<br>Platynereis dumerilii larvae (nectochaete) can switch between positive and negative phototaxis. Phototaxis there is<br>mediated by two pairs of more complex pigment cup eyes. These eyes contain more photoreceptor cells that are shaded by<br>pigment cells forming a cup. The photoreceptor cells do not synapse directly onto ciliated cells or muscle cells but<br>onto inter-neurons of a processing center. This way the information of all four eye cups can be compared and a low-<br>resolution image of four pixels can be created telling the larvae where the light is coming from. This way the larva<br>does not need to scan its environment by rotating. This is an adaption for living on the bottom of the sea the lifestyle<br>of the larva while scanning rotation is more suited for living in the open water column, the lifestyle of the<br>trochophore larva. Phototaxis in the Platynereis dumerilii larva has a broad spectral range which is at least covered by<br>three opsins that are expressed by the cup eyes: Two rhabdomeric opsins and a Go-opsin.<br>Platynereis dumerilii<br>However, not every behavior that looks like phototaxis is phototaxis: Platynereis dumerilii nechtochate and<br>metatrochophore larvae swim up first when they are stimulated with UV-light from above. But after a while, they change<br>the direction and avoid the UV-light by swimming down. This looks like a change from positive to negative phototaxis<br>(see video left), but the larvae also swim down if UV-light comes non-directionally from the side. And so they do not<br>swim to or away from the light, but swim down, this means to the center of gravity. Thus this is a UV-induced positive<br>gravitaxis. Positive phototaxis (swimming to the light from the surface) and positive gravitaxis (swimming to the center<br>of gravity) are induced by different ranges of wavelengths and cancel out each other at a certain ratio of wavelengths.<br>Since the wavelengths compositions change in water with depth: Short (UV, violet) and long (red) wavelengths are lost<br>first, phototaxis and gravitaxis form a ratio-chromatic depth gauge, which allows the larvae to determine their depth by<br>the color of the surrounding water. This has the advantage over a brightness based depth gauge that the color stays<br>almost constant independent of the time of the day or whether it is cloudy.<br>In the diagram on the right, the larvae start swimming upwards when UV-light switched on (marked by the violet square).<br>But later, they are swimming downward. The larval tracks are color coded: Red for upward and blue for downward swimming<br>larvae.

The direction where the light is coming from is<br>indicated by white bars.<br><br>Insects[edit]<br>Moths are positively phototactic<br>Positive phototaxis can be found in many flying insects such as moths, grasshoppers, and flies. Drosophila melanogaster<br>has been studied extensively for its innate positive phototactic response to light sources, using controlled experiments<br>to help understand the connection between airborne locomotion toward a light source. This innate response is common<br>among insects that fly primarily during the night utilizing transverse orientation vis-à-vis the light of the moon for<br>orientation. Artificial lighting in cities and populated areas results in a more pronounced positive response compared<br>to that with the distant light of the moon, resulting in the organism repeatedly responding to this new supernormal<br>stimulus and innately flying toward it.<br>Evidence for the innate response of positive phototaxis in Drosophila melanogaster was carried out by altering the wings<br>of several individual specimens, both physically (via removal) and genetically (via mutation). In both cases there was a<br>noticeable lack of positive phototaxis, demonstrating that flying toward light sources is an innate response to the<br>organisms' photoreceptors receiving a positive response.<br>Negative phototaxis can be observed in larval drosophila melanogaster within the first three developmental instar<br>stages, despite adult insects displaying positive phototaxis. This behaviour is common among other species of insects<br>which possess a flightless larval and adult stage in their life cycles, only switching to positive phototaxis when<br>searching for pupation sites.
